\begin{abstract}
%State-of-the-art distributed stream processing systems are powerful tools for building latency-conscious scalable computational pipelines. As the complexity of these pipelines grows, the validation of the result becomes a crucial task. In particular, testing that streaming data satisfies given statistical properties is an essential part of many real-life applications including spam detection, A/B testing, short-term personalization, etc. In this work, we analyze the potential of a decentralized approach to statistical validation over streaming data that is partitioned among multiple computational units. We discuss the main challenges, possible solutions, and preliminary results.

High-frequent stream processing is a very important research area. Powerful streaming algorithms are widely used in banking and financial analytics as the data is too huge to store it and also arrives at high frequencies so it needed to be processed as soon as possible to make a timely decision.

Change-point detection on a streaming data is used to track changes in credit card transactions, stock market ticks or computer network traffic. By the way, data can be produced too frequent, so it's desirable to distribute change-point detection over multiple nodes. Also values of statistics can be dependent and it's a challenge.

In this paper we introduce a distributed stream processing algorithm for change-point detection and try to explore importance of dependencies between incoming statistics.
