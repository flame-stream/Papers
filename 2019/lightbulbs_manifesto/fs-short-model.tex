Let $X^{+\infty}=\{x_t\}_{t=1}^{+\infty}$ be an input stream. Let $F_0$ and $F_1$ be different families of probability distributions, and $F_1$ is not known. Our task is for each $T\in \mathbb{N}$ test a hypothesis that $X^T=\{x_t\}_{t=1}^{T} \sim G(z)$, where $G(z) \in F_0$.

In distributed stream processing, data are partitioned among $n$ nodes, $X^{+\infty}=\bigsqcup_{i=1}^n X_i^{+\infty}$, where $X_i^{+\infty}=\{x_t^i\}_{t=1}^{+\infty}$. Let $y_T$ be a vector of test statistics from all computational nodes,  $y_T = (S(X_1^T),..,S(X_n^T))$. To solve the proposed task in a decentralized setting, we need to design a decision-making function $\varphi(y_T)$ such that $\varphi(y_T) = 0$, if $X^T \sim G(z)$  and $\varphi(y_T) = 1$ otherwise.

The problem is similar to decentralized change detection approaches~\cite{tartakovsky2008asymptotically, tran2014change}. However, these techniques consider a change from one unknown data distribution to another unknown one, while our task is to detect a change of a particular distribution family. Besides, these works do not take into account different data partition strategies peculiar to distributed streaming pipelines and important performance characteristics, e.g. throughput.
