In this work, we considered the problem of decentralized validation of statistical properties within distributed stream processing. We performed several preliminary experiments and achieved the following results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proposed problem statement is reasonable because ensures scalability, unlike centralized approach. However, it may reveal changes slower.
    \item Data partitioning matters: if each node receives only a limited subset of possible values, e.g. elements with a given range of balancing function values, then it can significantly influence detection time.
    \item A method for making the decision based on local decisions of independent computational units plays an important role in a performance.
\end{itemize}

Our ultimate intent is to design a framework for statistical validation within distributed stream processing. Regarding this task the following open problems exist:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigate how different data partitioning methods and decision-making approaches affects false positive and false negative rates.
    \item Adjust existing statistical tests for working with incomplete subsets of streaming data.
    \item Design an intelligent protocol that makes decisions based on local results and reduces detection time.
    \item Implement an intuitive API for working with the framework.
\end{itemize}
