Streaming applications often work with data that can be considered as values of some random variable with a given probability distribution. For example, user identifiers may be distributed uniformly or word frequencies from social networks text posts can fit Zipf distribution. The unexpected probability distribution of streaming data can directly influence the correctness of the final results:

\begin{itemize}
    \item In machine learning it is often assumed that training data fits a known distribution, e.g. a Gaussian. If this assumption is not satisfied, the model can provide poor performance.
    \item In A/B testing task, there is a need to ensure that users are uniformly distributed among application versions. Otherwise, experiment results may lead to inaccurate business decisions.
    \item ...
\end{itemize}

In this paper, we highlight the challenges of testing that streaming data fits a given distribution in {\em distributed} stream processing. In this case, the whole data is not processed on a single machine: it is partitioned among computational units in a cluster based on business-logic requirements. We demonstrate trade-offs between a naive and more complicated approach and discuss the preliminary results.
