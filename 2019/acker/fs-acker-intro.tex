% Something interesting is here~\cite{Carbone:2017:SMA:3137765.3137777}.

% Distributed stream processing systems commonly need to obtain notifications that some set of input elements and their descendants have already affected state or reached system frontiers. Such notifications can trigger state snapshotting mechanism~\cite{Carbone:2017:SMA:3137765.3137777, apache:storm}, the materialization of time-varying relations~\cite{Begoli:2019:OSR:3299869.3314040}, or atomic delivery of all descendants of an input item~\cite{we2018adbis}.
