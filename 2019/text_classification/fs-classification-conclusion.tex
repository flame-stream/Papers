In this work, we investigated the suitability of distributed stream processing engines to the problem of text streams classification. We demonstrated that there are several pitfalls with a straightforward approach. In particular, it was shown that exactly once is a strong requirement for unbiased reliable results. We also revealed that training pipeline cannot be straightforwardly embedded in a prediction pipeline. 

We proposed a data flow on a top of~\FlameStream\ processing system that mitigates the highlighted issues. We demonstrated that the proposed solution provides for low latency and linear scalability together with reasonable classification accuracy in a real-life scenario.
