Some works on text streams classification do not consider problems regarding scalability at all~\cite{zhang2008one}. There are plenty of projects that apply batch or micro-batch processing systems to scalable distributed text classification~\cite{semberecki2016distributed, 8029336, Nodarakis2016LargeSS, baltas2016apache, svyatkovskiy2016large, berral2015aloja}. However, as it was mentioned above, these methods are not suitable for streaming classification due to low latency requirements. 

Despite the fact that machine learning on top of distributed stream processing is a hot topic, previous works in this field do not consider issues related to the delivery guarantees and distributed environment~\cite{khumoyun2016real}. A SAMOA framework~\cite{morales2015samoa} provides implementations of several popular algorithms which can be executed on Flink, Storm or Samza but does not take responsibility for reproducible results and correctness in case of failures.

A need for reliable and reproducible machine learning at scale is formulated by the TFX project team~\cite{Baylor:2017:TTP:3097983.3098021}. However, this work does not connect these properties with a distributed stream processing.
