Most related prior works were implemented on Apache Spark \cite{semberecki2016distributed} \cite{8029336} \cite{Nodarakis2016LargeSS} \cite{baltas2016apache} \cite{svyatkovskiy2016large} or Apache Storm \cite{khumoyun2016real}. These platforms use micro-batching technique for processing data. However, such method provides high latency between obtaining a text and labelling it. In addition, all the methods above does not consider a concept drift as an issue.

Next work takes into account the concept drift and related to stream data nature \cite{zhang2008one}. However, the final solution is hard to scale into a cluster of machines efficiently.
