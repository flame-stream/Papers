While the classification of text streams is a well-studied problem, it is challenging to solve it at scale. There are plenty of projects that apply batch or micro-batch processing systems to distributed text classification~\cite{semberecki2016distributed, 8029336, baltas2016apache, svyatkovskiy2016large, Nodarakis2016LargeSS}. However, as it was mentioned above, these methods are not suitable for streaming classification due to low latency requirements. 

Despite the fact that machine learning on top of distributed stream processing is a hot topic, previous works in this field do not consider issues related to the delivery guarantees and distributed environment~\cite{khumoyun2016real}. A SAMOA framework~\cite{morales2015samoa} provides implementations of several popular algorithms which can be executed on Flink, Storm or Samza but does not take responsibility for reproducible results and correctness in case of failures.

Problems regarding machine learning at scale are formulated by the TFX project team~\cite{Baylor:2017:TTP:3097983.3098021}. Among them are continuous training, reliability, reproducibility, etc. It is shown that these problems are hard even if an environment is reliable and fault tolerant. In this work, we argue that these goals are even harder to achieve using state-of-the-art distributed stream processing systems.
