In this work, we investigated the suitability of distributed stream processing engines to the problem of text streams classification with the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Unbiased by distributed environment: node failures or races do not affect the ultimate result distribution.
    \item Reproducible: if input elements are stored in persistent storage, the same predictions are obtained on each new run.
\end{itemize}

We discussed several pitfalls with a straightforward approach and highlight several limitations regarding the choice of a processing engine and the structure of data flow:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Exactly once is a strong requirement.
    \item Embedding of time-consuming train process in the prediction pipeline leads to significant latency spikes.
\end{itemize}

As future work, we plan to implement a text classification framework that satisfies the proposed requirements and provides for low latency.
