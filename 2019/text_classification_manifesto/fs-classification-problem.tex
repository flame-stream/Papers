Let us consider the news topic classification as an illustration of a text stream multi-classification task. There are two input streams: pre-labeled and raw. The latter stream elements must be labeled by a classifier and delivered to end-user. The pre-labeled stream is used for updating a machine learning model with new data in order to adapt it to current events. The ultimate purpose is to achieve the distribution of news topics that is changed over time. This task is a typical representative of the text stream classification problem.

As the main requirement to a stream processing engine we claim the following: each output element must depend only on the input. In other words, node failures and execution environment parameters must not affect the results, similar to batch systems. Otherwise, it is hard to design a solution that provides reproducible and interpretable classification results.
