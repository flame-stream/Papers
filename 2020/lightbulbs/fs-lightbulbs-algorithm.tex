\subsection{Single-node algorithm}

Single-node algorithm should process elements from stream and return a statistic that characterise a state of the part of the stream passed through this node.

We use the window technique from the paper \cite{kifer2004detecting} which involves two windows: reference that stands at the beginning of the stream and sliding that moves as soon as new elements arrive. We calculate maximum value of distance between reference and sliding window for all positions of sliding window. More precisely we calculate the following statistic and return it as a result fo this node $$S_t = \max_{1 \le i \le t - (n + m) + 1} KS(reference, sliding_i)$$, where $$KS(X, Y) = \max_x \left|F_X(x) - F_Y(x)\right|$$ is Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic for emperical distributions $F_X$ and $F_Y$ of samples $X$ and $Y$.

\subsection{Fusion rule}

Fusion rule should recieve statistics from different nodes and decide wheter change has already happened or not.

We apply a simple multivariable function such as maximum, median or mean. We compare the obtained value to the precomputed threshold and if it's greater than we think that change has occured.
