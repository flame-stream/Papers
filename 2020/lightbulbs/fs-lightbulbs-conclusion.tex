In this work, we extended a popular algorithm for change detection in streaming data~\cite{kifer2004detecting} to make it suitable for distributed stream processing systems. The quality of the resulting algorithm was experementally confirmed.

The experimentally obtained quality is comparable with the state-of-the-art and slightly decreases with the growing number of computational nodes while detection latency increases sublinearly. It is explained by the fact that the multinode algorithm needs to process more elements to ``warm-up'' before it starts to detect changes. Experiments within distributed stream processing system demonstrated linear increase of throughput, which means that the algorithm is pretty scalable.

We demonstrated that our extension of single-node algorithm makes dataflows with change detection scalable with non-essential cost. Thus, it potentially increases the applicability of change detection to large streaming deployments.

Regarding our future work, we plan to investigate more data partitioning methods and how they affect the accuracy of our change detection algorithms. We also plan to modify the algorithm to make it more stable in the case when streaming elements are partitioned depending on their values.
