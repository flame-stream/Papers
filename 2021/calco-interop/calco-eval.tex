Semantics for the running example consists of the "fraudMetric" and "participants" nodes.
The environment has three sources, two one-arity operations, and two two-arity operations.

For example let us consider contracts of the bid-auction join and the fraud metric.
Join requires "bid.auction" and "auction.id" attributes and sets "joinBA" property:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
( InCont (Set.singleton "bid.auction")
         Set.empty Set.empty
, InCont (Set.singleton "auction.id")
         Set.empty Set.empty
, OutCont Set.empty
          (Set.singleton "joinBA") )
\end{lstlisting}

Fraud metric has one input contract with four alternatives:
only bid attributes
or joined bid and auction attributes
or joined bid and person attributes
or all attributes.

We implemented a graphs generation prototype in Haskell.
Our prototype generates all possible 6 execution graphs corresponding to the CGraph of the running example.
