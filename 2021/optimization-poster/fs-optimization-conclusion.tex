In this work, we considered the problem of adaptive optimization of streaming SQL queries in distributed stream processing engines. We argued the necessity of adaptive query optimization at the logical level and identified the following challenges in adapting database optimization techniques for streaming queries: fetching and predicting data statistics, using predicted statistics for the query optimization, and migrating the execution graph at runtime once the previous graph has become suboptimal. We performed experiments on a streaming SQL query to demonstrate the possibility of a gain in performance should the graph be adapted to the data statistics. As future work, we plan to implement a streaming query optimization agent which takes into consideration all of the abovementioned challenges.
