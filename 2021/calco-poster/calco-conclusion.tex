We have observed existing ways to specify computations in distributed data processing frameworks: concrete graph definition and SQL.
Also we have outlined disadvantages and limitations of these approaches.
We have considered an example of cross-domain optimization.
We have presented a novel framework called Calco to specify distributed dataflows.
It is based on the contracts, declarative specifications of the graph nodes properties.
We have proposed to define a whole set of equivalent execution graphs using the CGraph representation.
So using a cost evaluation function we can choose optimal graph from this set.
TODO evaluated example.
TODO Discussed challenges.
