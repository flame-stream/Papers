There are two common options to define computations in state-of-the-art distributed processing systems.
The first option is defining a logical {\em execution graph}.
An execution graph is a directed graph, where nodes represent operations and edges denote data flows.
This mechanism is robust and suitable for complex dataflows but has limited optimization abilities.
A processing system can apply only local physical optimizations because it cannot ensure that the restructured graph is equivalent to the original one.

Another way is declarative: the user defines the result that she aims to obtain, and the execution graph is generated automatically by the processing system.
The declarative approach is commonly implemented using SQL.
SQL is based on relational algebra that includes a set of operations and query transformation rules.
This way, a system can obtain multiple equivalent execution graphs and choose optimal one using a {\em cost model}.
Unfortunately, SQL is not rich enough to express some user-defined operations, e.g., complex machine learning pipelines~\cite{PROOF}.

In this work, we present a declarative framework called {\em Calco} to specify distributed dataflows.
Our framework is bases on the ideas from the contract programming~\cite{REF} and aim to solve the following problems:

{\bf Custom dataflows optimization}: user can annotate a custom operation by a {\em contract} which captures operation properties and allows the system to apply global optimization, e.g., to permute such operations.

{\bf Cross-domain optimization}: SQL can be automatically translated into Calco contracts and optimized together with custom user-defined operations.
