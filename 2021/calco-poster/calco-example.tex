Let's consider a small example of cross-query optimization.
Here we define two SQL queries and outline theirs expensive common parts.
Cross-query optimization for the SQL queries is not yet implemented (TODO ref to Dasha).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
SELECT person.name FROM buy
INNER JOIN person
ON buy.personId = person.id
INNER JOIN item
ON buy.itemId = item.id
WHERE person.age > 55
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
SELECT item.name FROM buy
INNER JOIN item ON buy.itemId = item.id
WHERE item.categoryId = 10
\end{lstlisting}

TODO SQL cross query optimization
