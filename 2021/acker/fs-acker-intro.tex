The processing of a data stream without insights on properties of its data elements can be challenging. For example, it may be unclear when a system can prune outdated keyed state~\cite{Tucker:2003:EPS:776752.776780}, release windowed aggregations~\cite{Begoli:2019:OSR:3299869.3314040}, or create a state snapshot for an epoch~\cite{Carbone:2017:SMA:3137765.3137777}.

Each of these scenarios can be considered as a special case of {\em substream management problem}. This problem is to monitor substreams emergence and termination. More formally, a substream is a part of the stream such that all its elements satisfy some predicate. For example, in the case of state pruning, the predicate is {\em [a data element has a key $K$]}, for time window aggregations, the predicate is {\em [a data element is generated with timestamp less than $T$]}, and for state snapshotting it is {\em [a data element belongs to the epoch $E$]}.

In this paper, we focus only on two signals: substream start and its termination. Tracking a start of a substream is a straightforward task: the first event of a substream will naturally trigger its start. On the contrary, generating a substream termination event is a challenging task, and various properties may be required by practical problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deterministic windowed join requires an order of termination signals to respect the order of input elements (termination events from data producers)~\cite{najdataei2019stretch, gulisano2016scalejoin}.
    \item An epoch is a substream that an SPE should process atomically. A termination event for an epoch should arrive before any elements of the next epoch~\cite{2015arXiv150608603C}.
    \item State pruning problem does not require any specific properties from termination events. However, late termination event receiving may cause sub-optimal memory utilization.
\end{itemize}

A popular substream management method is the punctuations framework~\cite{tucker2003exploiting}. The main idea behind this framework is to divide the stream injecting special elements called {\em punctuations} that define substreams ``borders''. While the punctuations approach is robust and easy-to-implement, it has two limitations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The lack of cyclic dataflows support~\cite{carbone2018scalable}. Many real-life applications, including machine learning~\cite{webirte} or graphs processing pipelines~\cite{xu2018fault}, require cyclic dataflows. The absence of a common substream management mechanism for this scenario reduces the applicability of SPEs for such tasks.
    \item High network traffic overhead. Punctuations framework has been initially designed for centralized stream processing~\cite{Tucker:2003:EPS:776752.776780} and requires frequent broadcasts between SPE nodes in distributed implementation. It can influence the end-to-end performance~\cite{DBLP:journals/pvldb/BegoliACHKKMS21} of SPEs and reduce their scalability because present-day deploys can consist of over 1000 nodes~\cite{Carbone:2017:SMA:3137765.3137777}. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

In this work we formalize the substream management problem and show that the network traffic overhead of the punctuations framework is far from the optimal. We also formally define properties of a substream management technique required by various problems such as state snapshotting to ensure that a newly proposed method satisfy them. 

We introduce a new substream management framework called \tracker. The high-level scheme of our method is shown in Figure~\ref{tracker_scheme}. Within this framework, we use a dedicated agent that receives information about substreams from the entire SPE and sends back {\em end-of-substream notifications} (NEOSS). NEOSS messages is propagated through this agent without broadcasting between processes, reducing the amount of extra traffic. Such propagation method is suitable for cyclic dataflows because there is no need to forward service traffic through the cycles.

Basic comparison between the \tracker\ framework and its alternatives is shown in Table~\ref{solutions-overview-table}. Regarding network traffic, $|\Pi|$ is the number of computational nodes and $K$ is the number of substreams. We can outline that the punctuations framework is the only substream management mechanism that supports arbitrary predicates for substreams, so we use it as a baseline approach in the experiments. The commonalities and differences between the \tracker\ framework and alternative solutions are detailed in Section~\ref{fs-acker-related}.

In summary, our contributions are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We provide a formal model of substream management. This model allows us to compare the properties of various substream management systems.
    \item We present a novel substream management technique that achieves a lower bound of network traffic overhead.
    \item We demonstrate \tracker\ performance in comparison to a state-of-the-art approach on diverse workloads.
\end{enumerate}

In Section~\ref{fs-acker-tracker}, we introduce a general design of the \tracker\ framework and demonstrate the properties of this substream management solution. Section~\ref{fs-acker-impl} summarizes the implementation of \tracker\. In Section~\ref{fs-experiments}, we show that the proposed technique is scalable and can outperform alternatives employed in state-of-the-art stream processing engines. The relevant prior research is outlined in Section~\ref{fs-acker-related}. Finally, we discuss our conclusions in Section~\ref{fs-acker-conclusion}.
