% is it plural. is it APIs??
The API of the current state-of-the-art systems typically utilizes a top-down approach to building a graph for query execution: first a logical graph is created, then it is transformed into a physical graph, which is later used for execution, leaving no opportunity to pass any data from the physical level to the logical level and use it to adapt the graph to the new data and therefore making any runtime adjustments to execution plans impossible. While progress has been made in applying various optimizations to the execution graphs at the physical level (see \cite{grulich2020grizzly} or Google Cloud Dataflow optimizer), there are no significant results in logical level optimization yet, and the logical level allows for more complex optimizations than the physical level.



% original notes
% state of the art systems API is top-down approach we create logical graph its transformed into physical and there's no way to pass info from execution to building graph level and we need that to migrate graph in runtime

% had it not been for idea to optimize logical graph and more complicated optimizations we do need to pass that info

% my only citation for dataflow is https://doi.org/10.1145/3328905.3338223 and idk if keynotes count as actual citations!
