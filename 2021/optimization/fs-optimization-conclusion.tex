In this paper, we considered the problem of adaptive optimization of streaming SQL queries in distributed stream processing engines. We argued the necessity of adaptive query optimization at the logical level and highlighted the differences between query optimization in database tables and data streams, which allowed us to identify the following challenges in adapting database optimization techniques for streaming queries: fetching and predicting data statistics, using predicted statistics for the query optimization, and migrating the execution graph in runtime once the statistics have changed enough that the previous execution plan becomes suboptimal. We presented a running example of
