We have observed existing ways to specify computations in distributed data processing frameworks: concrete graph definition and SQL.
Also we have outlined disadvantages and limitations of these approaches with explanations.

We have presented a novel approach to specify distributed dataflows.
It is based on the contracts, preconditions, and postconditions of the custom graph operations (their semantics).
Such specification has been called CGraph.
CGraph is a pair of environment and semantics, where the environment maps nodes to their contracts, and semantics is a set of nodes that produce dataflow target side-effects.
This representation allows us to generate all possible graphs with the needed semantics using defined operations.
So having a cost evaluation function we can choose the most optimal graph.

TODO example

We have discussed challenges about making CGraph specification API comfortable enough to solve real-world tasks and maintain these solutions.
Finally, we have studied problems that we will encounter in future work regarding the optimization: cost evaluation and the adaptivity loop implementation.
