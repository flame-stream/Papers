We review works which propose declarative approaches to define distributed computations and use it to make optimizations.
Most of such works are dedicated to the specific computational areas.

There are

For example: machine learning algorithms and graph queries processing.



Works dedicated to distributed machine learning algorithms implementation provide possibilities to effectively compute matrix operation TODO references.
