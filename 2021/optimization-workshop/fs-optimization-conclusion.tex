\label {sec:fs-optimization-conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced  the concept  of adaptive optimization of streaming SQL queries in distributed stream processing engines and highlighted the differences between adaptive optimization 	for database and stream queries. 
We argued the necessity of adaptive query optimization at both  logical and the physical levels.
We identify the following challenges in realization of  optimization techniques for streaming queries: 
fetching and predicting data statistics, 
using predicted statistics for the query optimization, and migrating the execution graph in runtime once the statistics have changed enough that the previous execution plan becomes suboptimal. 

We presented a running example of a streaming SQL query and performed experiments on this query and its different possible execution graphs to demonstrate the possibility of a gain in performance should the graph be adapted to the data statistics.
