We presented a novel approach to specify distributed dataflows.
It is based on the contracts, preconditions and postconditions of the graph operations.
We considered a small machine leaning streaming pipeline example, way of thinking that allows to specify dataflows in the presented way, and showed generated concrete graphs with different cost.
Also we discussed optimization challenges and pointed out contract interface enhancements that should make specification more convenient to use.
Finally, we showed ideas for the future work enhancements.

We propose to specify dataflow as CGraph (contracted graph).
CGraph is a pair of environment and semantics, where environment maps nodes to their contracts, and semantics is the set of nodes that produce dataflow target side-effects.
Lots of concrete graphs can be generated from the CGraph.
In the future work we plan to develop cost function that will allow to choose the most optimal concrete graphs from generated.

However, it was said that using of the raw contracts is not convenient.
And it is important to develop tools and methods to simplify it.
