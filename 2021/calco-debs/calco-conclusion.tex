In this paper, we considered the problem of computational graphs optimization in distributed stream processing engines.
We proposed a new approach of defining computational graphs (c-graph) based on a set of operations, annotated with contracts, that allows to generate all graphs with the needed semantics.
Also, we discussed generating algorithm and took a view on the c-graphs usage example that gave us a new way to think about stream processing tasks and their solutions.
