We have presented a novel approach to specify distributed dataflows.
It is based on the contracts, preconditions, and postconditions of the graph operations.
Such specification has been called CGraph (contract-graph).
CGraph is a pair of environment and semantics, where the environment maps nodes to their contracts, and semantics is a set of nodes that produce dataflow target side-effects.
We have provided an algorithm that generates all concrete execution graphs that satisfy contracts and semantics.
So having a cost evaluation function we can choose the most optimal graph.

We have considered a machine learning streaming problem, which cannot be solved using SQL. % TODO SQL proof
And the only possible way to specify it is an execution graph, that represents rather an imperative approach then declarative, hence does not provide enough space for optimizations.
We have specified the example problem by CGraph using Haskell prototype DSL and pointed out that the most optimal graph exists in the set of concrete execution graphs, generated from CGraph.

Finally, we have studied problems that we will encounter in future work regarding the optimization: preliminary cost evaluation and the adaptivity loop implementation.
