We have presented a novel approach to specify distributed dataflows.
It is based on the contracts, preconditions and postconditions of the graph operations.
Such specification has been called CGraph (contract-graph).
CGraph is a pair of environment and semantics, where environment maps nodes to their contracts, and semantics is a set of nodes that produce dataflow target side-effects.
We have provided an algorithm that generates all concrete execution graphs that satisfy contracts and semantics.
So having a cost evaluation function we can choose the most optimal graph.

We have considered the a machine learning streaming problem, which cannot be solved using SQL. % TODO SQL proof
And the only possible way to specify it is execution graph, that represents rather imperative approach then declarative, hence do not provide enough space for optimizations.
% TODO We provided the prototype?
We have specified the example problem by CGraph and pointed out that the most optimal graph exists in the set of concrete execution graphs, generated from CGraph.

We have studied problems that we will encounter in future work regarding to the optimization:
% TODO Preliminary cost evaluation
% TODO Runtime statistics gathering
% TODO Cost evaluation by statistics analysis
% TODO Actor entity that decides, whether to restructure execution graph
% TODO How to restructure execution graph in runtime
