In this paper, we considered the problem of computational graphs optimization in distributed stream processing engines for ETL use cases.
It was noticed that the main problem is lack of the information about the goal provided by the current ways of computational graph defining.
To solve this issue we proposed a new contract-based approach of graph defining that embodies the possibility to generate all graphs with the needed semantics to be able to choose the most optimal one automatically.
Thus, we implemented a proof-of-concept prototype in Haskell and Python interface blueprint to plug it into Apache Beam.
At last, we demonstrated the proposed concept on the real-world ELT task.
