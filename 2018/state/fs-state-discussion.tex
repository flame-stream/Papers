Hence, non-deterministic systems that use state snapshots must atomically output elements and take a consistent snapshot that contains their inverted dependencies. In practice, it means that the lower bound of latency in the worst case in such systems is the duration of snapshotting. Besides, there is a trade-off between latency and the frequency of taking snapshots.

On the other hand, if a system is deterministic, atomicity between output and snapshotting is not necessary, because in case of replay system releases exactly the same output, that can be simply deduplicated at the very last node in a data flow. Therefore, the open questions are: is it more efficient in practice to handle non-determinism by atomic snapshotting and output or not? Can determinism be implemented in a more effective way than snapshotting?
