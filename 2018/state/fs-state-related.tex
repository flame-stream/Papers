Many prior works in the field of stream processing do not consider consistency maintaining as a high priority task. For instance, Aurora~\cite{Abadi:2003:ANM:950481.950485} and Borealis~\cite{abadi2005design} prefer availability and low latency rather than consistency guarantees. Some other works provide only partial consistency. Apache Storm~\cite{apache:storm} supports message tracking mechanism that prevents the loss of data. However, exactly-once semantics is not provided, because duplicates are still possible. Twitter Heron, that was presented as the next generation of Apache Storm~\cite{Kulkarni:2015:THS:2723372.2742788}, does not provide for exactly once as well. Samza~\cite{Noghabi:2017:SSS:3137765.3137770} also implements fairly similar to Storm model and has the same consistency guarantees.  

{\it Micro-batching} is a popular approach to achieve exactly once semantics by combining batch and stream processing. The main idea behind this method is to treat input data as a sequence of small-sized batches. If data items are continuously arriving, they can be packaged into batches at system's entry and then processed in batch manner. Spark Streaming~\cite{Zaharia:2012:DSE:2342763.2342773} introduces {\it discretized streams} model that is based on micro-batching idea and is unified with Spark's batch processing. Storm Trident~\cite{apache:storm:trident} implements micro-batching on top of Apache Storm. The main advantage of micro-batching technique is that its properties are naturally derived from batch processing model. Therefore, systems which use this approach are fault tolerant and provide strong consistency. However, such systems experience heavy overhead in terms of end-to-end latency, because of the buffering on input.   

Another way to provide exactly once semantics is to release output items only when the system is ensured that they are consistent and system's restart will not cause releasing duplicates. Apache Flink~\cite{Carbone:2017:SMA:3137765.3137777} uses the variation of Chandy-Lamport algorithm~\cite{Chandy:1985:DSD:214451.214456} for state snapshotting mechanism. This mechanism allows the system to restart processing from some determined points. However, because of the non-deterministic computational model, there is a need to take state snapshots and release output items atomically. To solve this task the adaptation of 2PC protocol for distributed transactions is used. Similar approach for exactly-once processing is applied in IBM Streams~\cite{jacques2016consistent}. The main problem regarding this method is that distributed transactions can provide significant latency overhead, because output items cannot be released until transaction is committed. Google's MillWheel~\cite{Akidau:2013:MFS:2536222.2536229} uses slightly different approach to get the same result. It defines the order on data items and each stateful operation buffers its input before it is ensured that there are no out-of-order items up the stream. This behavior makes processing deterministic, and exactly-once is easily achieved by deduplication. Nevertheless, extra buffering before each stateful operation can potentially lead to heavy latency overhead as well.
