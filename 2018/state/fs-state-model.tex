\label {fs-model-section}

In this section we outline the model of our system. We focus on the core concepts and definitions in order to introduce the necessary preliminaries for consistency preserving mechanisms.

\subsection{Data flow}
The basic data flow abstraction is a {\it stream}. The stream is represented by an infinite heterogeneous sequence of data items. Data item is a {\it payload} and a {\it meta-information} associated with it. 

\[DataItem := (Payload, Meta)\]

The payload is an arbitrary user-provided data. Meta is structured system-assigned information. The primary purpose of the meta-information is to impose the total order on data items. 

Data payloads are generated by data producers and are got into the stream through {\it front}. They got out of the stream to data consumers through {\it barrier}. Front creates data items from input events by assigning them meta-information. Inside stream, data items can be dropped or their payloads and metas can be transformed. Barrier removes meta-information and outputs back pure payloads. 

A high-level view of a stream is shown in Figure~\ref{stream}.

\subsection{Computational flow}
The stream between front and barrier is handled by a directed data flow graph. Each node of the graph represents a single operation, which can have multiple inputs and outputs. Edges indicate the order of these operations. Data items are processed one-by-one in a "streaming" manner. Figure~\ref{logical-graph-figure} shows the example of data flow graph. Our model allows cycles in the graph while data flow graphs are commonly assumed to be acyclic (DAGs) 
~\cite{Zaharia:2016:ASU:3013530.2934664, Carbone:2017:SMA:3137765.3137777}.

\subsection{Physical deployment and partitioning}
Data flow graph is distributed among computational units. Each unit runs a process called {\it worker}, and each of the workers executes complete data flow graph. The range of 32-bit signed integer is divided into the fixed number of non-intersecting {\it hash units}. Each worker can be responsible for one or many hash units. Hash units are used further for partitioning and state saving. The number of hash-units per worker is a user-defined parameter and it must be set before the start of computations. 

Each operation input has a user-provided hash function called {\it balancing function}. This function is applied to the payload of data items and determines partitioning before each operation. After that, the data items are sent to the worker, which is responsible for the associated hash unit. Therefore, load balancing explicitly depends on the user-defined balancing functions. This allows the developer to determine optimal balancing which requires the knowledge of the payload distribution. The system optimizes the hash ranges assignment according to the processing statistics.

\subsection{Ordering assumptions}
We assume that there is a total order on data items. Ordering is preserved when an item is going through the operations. More precisely, the order of output items is the same as the order of corresponding input items. If more than one item is generated, they are inserted in output stream sequentially. Moreover, the output follows corresponding input but precedes the next item. Without diving into details, it should be noted that the order of items is maintained across different fronts.

The concept of ordering is shown in Figure~\ref{ordering}. Data item with payload $1'$ is the derivative of the item with payload $1$, according to operation $F$. The same is for items with payloads $2'$ and $2$. After union operation, the order between $1$ and $2$ is preserved. Furthermore, $1'$ follows $1$, and $2'$ follows $2$.  
\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pics/ordering}
  \caption{The concept of ordering model}
  \label {ordering}
\end{figure}

We assume that input items of the operations are strictly ordered.

\subsection{Supported operations}
The list of available operations includes:

{\bf Map} applies a user-defined function to the payload of an input item. This function returns a sequence of data items with transformed payloads. An output sequence can be empty.

{\bf Broadcast} replicates an input item to the specified number of operations.

{\bf Merge} operation is initialized with the specified number of input nodes. It sends all incoming data to the output.

{\bf Grouping} has a {\it window size} parameter. Grouping stores input items into distinct buckets by the value of the input balancing function applied to the payload. When the next item arrives at the grouping, it is appended to the corresponding bucket. Each time the grouping outputs window-sized {\it tuple item}, which consists of the most recent (in terms of the meta-information) items of this bucket. If the size of the bucket is less than the window, all items of the bucket are taken. Grouping is the only operation that has a state.

The following example illustrates the semantics of the operation. The grouping accepts items with payload represented as natural numbers: 1,2,3, etc. The hash function returns 1 if the number is even and 0 otherwise. If the window is set to 3, the output is:

\[(1), (2), (1|3), (2|4), (1|3|5), (2|4|6), (3|5|7), (4|6|8)...\]

There are two important properties of the grouping operation: the output tuple is identified by its last element, the results among items with different values of a hash function are independent.

\subsection{Stateful transformations}
The given set of operations jointly with cyclic execution graphs is enough to implement any stateful operation, i.e. reduce in terms of MapReduce model. The scheme of such transformations is out of the scope of this paper, however, it is deeply detailed in~\cite{we2018seim}.

\subsection{Consistency guarantees}
There are three main types of consistency guarantees relating to stream processing. {\it At most once} semantics states that each input event is processed once or not processed at all. {\it At least once} guarantees that each input item is processed, but possibly multiple times, that can lead to result duplication. {\it Exactly once} semantics guarantee that each input event is processed exactly one time. The techniques to achieve these guarantees in the presence of failures are detailed in the next section.

\subsection{Implementation notes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Physical operations and hash units: the state is identified by hash unit
    \item Fronts and rears
    \item Deterministic model is real! There are extra items, they can be cleared at the barrier, if we know min time  %<-- Here we introduce the barrier!
    \item Acker - min time provider. Acker observes the progress of the full system. Can play the role of the master %<-- Here we introduce min time notifications
\end{itemize}
