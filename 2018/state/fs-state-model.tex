%%% fs-state-model - Model

\label {fs-model-section}

This section contains the high-level view of our model and a few implementation details.

\subsection{Data flow}
Define stream and data items.

\subsection{Computational flow}
Flow is represented in the form of a graph.

\subsection{Ordering assumptions}
The main idea: we define a total ordering on items to achieve determinism.

\subsection{Supported operations}
Map/grouping and their properties. Grouping's window can be > 2: e.g. merge of 3 streams.

\subsection{Stateful transformations}
Pipeline for any stateful transformation using only map and grouping. 

\subsection{Consistency guarantees}
At most once, at least once, exactly once. Exactly once is achieved if failures do not occur.

\subsection{Implementation notes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Physical operations and hash units: state is identified by hash unit
    \item Fronts and rears
    \item Deterministic model is real! There are extra items, they can be cleared at the barrier, if we know min time  %<-- Here we introduce the barrier!
    \item Acker - min time provider. Acker observes progress of the full system. Can play the role of the master %<-- Here we introduce min time notifications
\end{itemize}
