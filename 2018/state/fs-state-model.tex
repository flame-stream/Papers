\label {fs-model-seciton}

This section contains the high-level view of our model and a few implementation details.

\subsection{Data flow}
Define stream and data items.

\subsection{Computational flow}
Flow is represented in the form of a graph.

\subsection{Ordering assumptions}
The main idea: we define a total ordering on items to achieve determinism.

\subsection{Physical deployment}
The graph is deployed on each node. Hash-units, partitioning, etc.

\subsection{Supported operations}
Map/grouping and their properties.

\subsection{Stateful transformations}
Pipeline for any stateful transformation using only map and grouping. 

\subsection{Implementation notes}
In this section we describe how proposed model can be efficiently implemented without diving into details.

\subsection{Consistency guarantees}
At most once, at least once, exactly once. Exactly once is achieved if failures do not occur.
