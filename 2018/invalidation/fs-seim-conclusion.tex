\label {fs-conclusion}

In this paper we introduce an optimistic approach for handling out-of-order events. Our technique has the following key properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It does not require buffering before each order-sensitive operation
    \item The method handles properly any statful operation
    \item The overhead of the proposed approach is low (under 10\% in most of our experiments)
    \item The total overhead could be managed by optimization of the computational layout
\end{itemize}

The optimistic nature of this method is able to help to reduce the cost of waiting for punctuations or watermarks. It is implied by the fact, that at the moment when the watermark arrives all computations are already done. 

The experiments show that the number of the extra items does not increase with the growth of the number of the computational units. Therefore, this approach can potentially provide lower latency in stream processing systems.
