%%% fs-seim-optimistic - Optimistic approach

\label {fs-optimistic}

In this section firstly we show that reduce stage can be implemented using windowed grouping and map operations with cycle in execution graph. After that, proposed optimistic technique is demonstrated. Eventually, we discuss the limitations of such technique.

\subsection{Reduce through grouping, map, and cycle}
The pipeline for reduce stage is shown in the figure.
