%%% fs-seim-optimistic - Optimistic approach

\label {fs-optimistic}

In this section, firstly, we show that any stateful transformation can be implemented using the combination of windowed grouping and map operations. After that, we demonstrate an optimistic approach to handle out-of-order items within these operations. Eventually, the limitations of such technique are discussed.
