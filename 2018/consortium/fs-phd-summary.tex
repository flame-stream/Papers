In this work we discussed a problem that we are working on - providing reliable, efficient, and convenient high-level consistency guarantees within distributes stream processing. Currently, state-of-the-art stream processing systems concentrate only on proving low-level consistency guarantees. However, it was realized that providing high-level guarantees on the top of low-level can significantly improve the efficiency of stream analytics. 

We recognized the following main problems on the way of achieving our goal:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Design low-overhead approach for achieving low-level consistency in order to use it as a building block for high-level guarantees  
    \item Invent convenient and reliable mechanisms to declaratively define high-level guarantees in terms of semantical types
    \item Realize the correspondence between distinct high-level and low-level consistency requirements
    \item Efficiently implement meta-stream processing for handling complex high-level guarantees
    \item Bind data management and statistics in order to obtain reliable and valuable results  
\end{itemize}

Our current contribution is a novel stream processing model that provides for exactly once with extremely low overhead~\cite{we2018seim, we2018beyondmr}. Although this result is a desired part of the full project, there a lot of an ongoing theoretical and practical work on our track.
