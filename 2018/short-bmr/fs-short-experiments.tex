We conducted a  series of experiments to estimate the performance of our  prototype. We used a problem of building an incremental inverted index as a stream processing benchmark  for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It requires stateful operations
    \item Computational flow contains network shuffle that can violate the ordering constraints 
    enabling evaluation of our optimistic techniques.
\end{itemize}

In the real-world, such scenario can be found in freshness-aware systems, e.g., news processing engines.
