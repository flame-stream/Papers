We presented the architecture that achieves exactly-once semantics using strong ordering property, that implies determinism and idempotence. These features are obtained using the lightweight speculative technique that requires single buffer per computational pipeline. Experiments demonstrated that our approach provides extremely low overhead for exactly-once semantics (under 20\%) and can outperform an alternative solution.
