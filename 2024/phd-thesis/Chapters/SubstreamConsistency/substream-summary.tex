In this chapter we presented a formal model for the substream management problem and established a theoretical lower bound for this overhead. We demonstrated that state-of-the-art punctuation framework is far from the theoretically optimal approach. Additionally, we showed the key properties that a substream management technique must fulfill to support tasks such as state snapshotting, ensuring that newly proposed methods adhere to these requirements.
