Our first step is to identify the actual challenges. The challenges have been identified throughout preparation of our prior publications~\cite{we2018adbis, trofimov2018consistency, we2018seim, we2018beyondmr, we2019debs, webirte, thepaper, 10.1145/3524860.3539809, trofimov2023bounding}. We briefly discuss them in Section~\ref{thesis-intro-challenges}. The corresponding literature is reviewed in Chapter~\ref{thesis-chapter-literature-review}.

After the identification of challenges, we design a formal model suitable to describe the corresponding domain. This step allows us to theoretically justify the challenges, compare existing approaches, highlight their advantages and limitations, and identify areas for improvement.

In the third step, we verify whether our theoretical findings align with experimental studies. At this stage, our goal is to develop technical implementations and ensure that our theoretically more efficient approaches are feasible in practice.
