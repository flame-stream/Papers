The novelty of this work lies in addressing open challenges and achieving results that surpass the current state-of-the-art. The theoretical models we have designed describe a wider range of real-life problems and scenarios than existing alternatives. Additionally, our practical approaches and algorithms outperform those found in current research and industry standards. 

More specifically, this work brings the following novelty:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Formal model for delivery guarantees, and a demonstration based on this model that deterministic SPEs can theoretically outperform non-deterministic ones in terms of latency.
    \item Experimental demonstration that deterministic SPE outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of latency.
    \item Formal model for substream management, and a demonstration based in this model of the lower bound of extra network traffic for detecting substream termination.
    \item Implementation of the substream management framework reaching the lower bound of extra network traffic and demonstration that it outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.
\end{enumerate}
