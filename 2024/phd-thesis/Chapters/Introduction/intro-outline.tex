The rest of the dissertation is structured as follows: Chapter~\ref{thesis-chapter-literature-review} covers the literature review of the consistency and fault tolerance in distributed stream processing. In Chapter~\ref{thesis-chapter-delivery-guarantees} we formalize the delivery guarantees and demonstrate that deterministic systems can be theoretically more efficient for exactly-once than non-deterministic in terms of latency. In Chapter~\ref{thesis-chapther-optimistic} we indtroduce a lightweight approach for achievening determinism and exactly-once and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives. Chapter~\ref{thesis-chapter-substreams-consistency} covers the formal model for the substream consistency and the estimation of the lower bound for extra network traffic required by substream management mechanisms. In Chapter~\ref{thesis-chapter-tracker} we present the substream management technique reaching the lower bound of extra network traffic and demonstrate its practical feasibility. In Chapter~\ref{thesis-chapter-conclusion}, we conclude by summarizing our findings and discussing future directions.
