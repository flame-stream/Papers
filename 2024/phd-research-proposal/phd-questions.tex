\label{phd_questions}

In this work, we aim to answer the following research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the reasons behind the high latency within exactly-once guarantee in state-of-the-art SPEs?
    \item Can deterministic stream processing systems theoretically be more efficient regarding latency than non-deterministic? 
    \item What is the theoretical lower bound estimation of required network traffic to detect that the result update is ready in a distributed environment? 
    \item Is it possible to provide a technique that achieves this lower bound, and will it be more practically efficient than state-of-the-art? 
\end{enumerate}
