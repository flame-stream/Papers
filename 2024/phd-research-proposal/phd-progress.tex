Several steps have already been taken toward achieving the research objectives:

\begin{itemize}
\item We formalized delivery guarantees and showed that determinism is tightly connected with delivery guarantees~\cite{thepaper, we2018seim, trofimov2018consistency}
\item We implemented deterministic stream processing system and showed that it can outperform state-of-the-art alternatives~\cite{we2018adbis, we2018beyondmr, webirte}
\item We estimated theoretical lower bound for completeness of results problem~\cite{10.1145/3524860.3539809, trofimov2023bounding}
\item We implemented technique for completeness monitoring that achieves lower bound and showed that in can be more efficient for real-life problems including state snapshotting~\cite{10.1145/3524860.3539809, trofimov2023bounding}
\end{itemize}

Significant progress has been made in all the main declared areas. To complete the work, the remaining task is to compile all the results and describe their combined contributions to completeness monitoring and ensuring delivery guarantees.
