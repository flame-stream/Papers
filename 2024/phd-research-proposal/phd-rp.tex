\title {Research Proposal: Consistent Scalable Processing of Data Streams in  a Distributed Environment
}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The low latency requirement presents two major challenges in distributed stream processing. Firstly, a stream processing engine (SPE) needs sophisticated fault tolerance mechanisms to ensure quick recovery and data consistency in case of failures. Secondly, there is the challenge of continuously producing a results stream during processing. Detecting the exact moment when the resulting item is ready to be released in a distributed environment can be non-trivial. State-of-the-art approaches to both fault tolerance and results updating still result in high processing latency.
In this proposal, we review state-of-the-art techniques that address these issues. We highlight promising directions to achieve the exactly-once guarantee with lower latency, due to the reduced overhead required to ensure consistency during processing. We also propose a theoretically more efficient approach to forming a result stream, even when dealing with high granularity of results. We outline research questions that need to be explored to validate our ideas.
