In this research proposal, we focus on the problems of fault tolerance, consistency, and producing results stream for distributed stream processing. We reviewed state-of-the-art works and offered theoretical approaches that can reduce latency overhead for the mentioned problems. Based on these observations, we formulated research questions that should be answered in the dissertation.
