In this research proposal, we focus on the problems of consistency maintenance and substream management for distributed stream processing. We reviewed state-of-the-art works and highlighted potential tight relations between consistency guarantees, determinism, and substream management. Based on these observations, we formulated research questions that should be answered in the dissertation.
