A need to process huge amounts of data (e.g. Internet scale) was addressed by distributed data processing systems such as Google's MapReduce~\cite{Dean:2008:MSD:1327452.1327492} and Apache Hadoop~\cite{hadoop2009hadoop}. These systems are able to run in a massively parallel fashion on clusters consisting of thousands of commodity computational units. The main advantages of this approach are fault-tolerance and practically unlimited scalability.

Several drawbacks of the initial models and architectures of this kind are deeply analyzed in~\cite{Doulkeridis:2014:SLA:2628707.2628782}. Many of these drawbacks were addressed in the next generation of scalable distributed data processing architectures, e.g. Asterix~\cite{Alsubaiee:2012:ASW:2331801.2331803}, Spark~\cite{Zaharia:2016:ASU:3013530.2934664}, and Flink~\cite{carbone2015apache}.
