\begin{abstract}
A user of current distributed stream processing systems has to choose between non-deterministic computation and high latency due to a need in excessive buffering. 
%In addition, a sophisticated state management must be implemented at the business logic level to provide fault tolerance. 
We present a distributed stream processing engine based on a deterministic computational model and providing low latency. 
Experiments show that our prototype can outperform existing solutions due to low overhead of optimistic synchronization.


%In recent years, there has been a growth in research and industrial solutions in the field of distributed stream processing. 
%However, even state-of-the-art stream processing systems are inconvenient to work with in some ways. 
%Firstly, existing solutions suppose that the state of operations should be managed directly by a user, and that can be confusingly for inexperienced users of analytical processing systems. 
%Secondly, these systems do not provide for deterministic processing by default. 
%Furthermore, the most common approach for this feature is buffering. 
%Its main problem is the extra cost for blocking before each order-sensitive operation. 
%The goal of this paper is to propose a model, which addresses both recognized issues. 
%On the one hand, our model stateless from the business logic perspective. 
%Such behavior is obtained by the technique that allows a state to be a part of a stream. 
%On the other hand, it is deterministic by design. 
%We introduce an optimistic method that avoids buffering before each operation to achieve determinism with low overhead. 
%The experiments show that prototype of our system requires a low extra cost for supporting proposed features and is able to outperform alternative industrial solutions in certain conditions.
