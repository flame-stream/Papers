\begin{abstract}
Current generation of scalable distributed systems designed for analytical processing of large volumens of data (such as  Spark and Flink) have addressed several drawbacks of previous generation. The ability to optimize and process complex analytical workflows  provides for improved performance and flexibility.

However, several issues still remain. This paper describes a run-time components of a scalable distributed environment that guaranttes exctly once  processing and (list here more advantages). The experiments show that this implementation can outperform alternative solutions.
