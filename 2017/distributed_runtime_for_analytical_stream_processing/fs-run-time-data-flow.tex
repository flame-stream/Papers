\label {fs-data-flow}

The top level of our data flow abstraction is a {\it stream}. Stream is represented by an ordered unlimited sequence of data items. Data item is a {\it payload} and a {\it meta-data} associated with it. Payload is an arbitrary user-provided data. Meta-data is a structured system-assigned information. The primary purpose of the meta-data is to impose the total order on data items. 

\[DataItem := (payload, Meta)\]

Data payloads are got in stream through {\it front} and got out through {\it barrier}. Particularly, front creates data items from input payloads by assigning them meta-data. Inside stream, data items can be dropped or their payloads can be transformed. Eventually, barrier removes meta-information and outputs back pure payloads. The concept of the stream is shown on the figure <>.
