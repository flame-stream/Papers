%%%% fs-run-time-data-flow  FlameStream data flow

\label {fs-data-flow}

Our main entity is a stream. Stream is an ordered unlimited sequence of DataItems. DataItems is a unstructured payload and a structured meta-data associated with it. Meta-data is used primarily for ordering. There is a total order on meta-data.

\subsection{Scope of FlameStream}

There is a front and barrier. Front is an entrance, barrier is an exit. Front assignes meta-data, barrier removes it. See figure 1. Everything in between is an ordered stream of dataitems that is managed by runtime.
