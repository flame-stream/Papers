\label {fs-conclusions}



In this paper, we presented stream processing model that provides for the following key features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item User is relieved from the direct working with the state. It is implemented using drifting state technique, which allows state to be the part of the stream in the form of an ordinal data item  
    \item The computational process is deterministic up to the time assignment at fronts. Novel optimistic approach for handling out-of-order items is designed to achieve this property
\end{itemize}

Both features are able to significantly simplify the development of stream processing workflows, because the system takes on itself all complexity related to state management and order constraints maintenance.

Besides,
