\label {fs-timing-model}

As it was mentioned above, meta-information imposes explicit total order on data items. Without diving into the details, it should be noted that the order of items is maintained across different fronts.

Let {\it image} is an output data item of an operation and {\it preimage} is a corresponding input item. In this terms, the order of images is preserved, i.e. the order of images is the same as the order of preimages. Moreover, the image of the item is greater than its preimage but less than the next item. The concept of ordering is shown on the figure <>.

We assume that input items of the operations are strictly ordered. The approach for satisfying such ordering properties is detailed in the following sections.

It is worth to mention, that after the meta-data is assigned to data item at the front, the rest of computations become deterministic.
