%%%% fs-run-time-timing Timing model

\label {fs-timing-model}

There is an explicit total order on dataitems. Once element is produced at front it is assigned a GlobalTime, current wall-clock of the front. This allows to order items across different fronts. This ordering is preserve even after operations that is the order of images is the same as order of preimage. Moreover the image of the first element is greater than its preimage but less than the second element. It is shown on figure 7.


The semantic of operation asume that input elements are strictly ordered. The particular form of meta-information that has such ordering properties is shown in the following sections.

It is worth mentioning that after assigning the GlobalTime at the front the rest of computations is determined.
